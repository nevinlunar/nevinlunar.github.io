    <h1>The Lunar Chronicles</h1>
    <p title="My Mzambakhulu" id="nev">
  I wanna leave, turning my back to the wind. My heart is racing, spirit hovering &my soul is certainly restless. Thinking about all the shit that happened. Halting in the entrance am transfixed. I see her, so poised, it's irritating. Am tempted to throw something, antything but.. I can't, remaining breathless, atmost speechless. My heart immediately swells when she smiles. I bite my lip to shun the feeling of laughter. I feel it on my skin. That aura of tranquility, watching her is all I wanna do. Seeing her with a heart  of glass. Like it's gonna break for it's delicate, very fragile. Then I realize all i wanna do is be with her. She's locked away in my heart. I wanna keep her there eternally. This adorement getting the better part of my soul, if I really had any though. She's got a tender heart. The one that could gauge your heart. Making it weightless, maybe terrified. In no time Asian eyes stole my heart. I fell, & just like that I was in a trance with no way back. She's surely turned up a new flame inside me. My head is spinning Coz she totally owns it. Words won't come out, yet I wanna whisper her name: Slow, like real slow and sweet. Totally worth itcoz I'll just go numb when she looks to answer. And it's that perfect moment when her words sooth my heart. My Mzambakhulu, just good enough for me. So i take my time and think it through. Maybe I'd some day think with my heart and not mind.... </p>
